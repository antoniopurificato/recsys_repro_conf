# Sequential Recommender Systems Reproducibility Analysis
This is the code for the paper Sequential Recommender Systems Reproducibility Analysis.

**EasyRec** is a versatile Python library carefully designed to streamline the process of configuring and building Sequential Recommender Systems models using the power and robust capabilites of PyTorch Lightning and PyTorch models.

## üåü Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Configuration:** EasyRec revolutionizes the way you work with Sequential Recommender Systems by providing a seamless configuration-based interface. All your settings can be easily defined in YAML files, making it effortless to customize and fine-tune your experiments.

2. **Three Essential Utilities:**
   - üìä **Data:** EasyRec simplifies data handling, allowing you to load and preprocess data effortlessly.
   - üìù **Experiments:** Define, track, and save experiments with unique IDs to prevent duplication. Keep your work organized and accessible.
   - ‚öôÔ∏è **Torch Integration:** Seamlessly integrate PyTorch models, train, test, and save your models with minimal effort. EasyRec handles the heavy lifting, so you can focus on innovation.

## üìÅ Important Files and Folders in the Project

Below is an outline of key files and folders you'll find in this project, along with their purposes:


### Utilities
1. **easy_exp**
    - Includes functions for experiment handling, such as creating experiment IDs, saving and loading experiments, and managing experiment logs.
2. **easy_rec**
    - Includes functions for data pre-processing and dataloaders creation
    - Defines Sequential Recommendation Models
    - Contains IR metrics, such as NDCG, Recall, and MRR
    - Provides losses for model's training and evaluation
3. **easy_torch**
    - Includes functions for metrics, loading models, and creating trainers in PyTorch Lightning.
    - Defines steps, loss, optimizer, and other parameters to use.
    - Sets callbacks and dataloaders.
    - Also includes utilities for training and testing the model, as well as saving and reading logs.

### Folders

1. **cfg**
    - Contains the configurations used in the testing phase of this repo: these are YAML files nested inside each other. The main one is config_rec.yaml, where you specify the name of the experiment.
      - data_cfg: loading and preprocessing parameters of the dataset.
      - model: optimizer, metrics and name of the model used.
      - trainer_params_cfg: accelerator, number of epochs, logger to save files.
      - loader_params_cfg: batch size, number of workers, number of negatives.
      - emission_tracker: configuration for [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/).
      - flops_profiler: configuration for [DeepSpeed](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
      - rec_models: specific configurations for each model.
2. **ntb**
    - Houses a notebook for training and testing a Sequential Recommender System on a dataset.
3.  **out**
    - Includes metrics and energy consumption for each experiments. Also includes the saved parameters of the best model per single run.


## How to run an experiment

To run our code follow the next steps:

- Download and install easy_lightning.
  
``pip3 install  --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/PokeResearchLab/easy_lightning.git``

- Download this repo.
  
``git clone https://github.com/antoniopurificato/recsys_repro_conf && cd recsys_repro_conf``

- Install the necessary requirements.

``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
- Download the data;

``cd ntb && bash download_data.bash``
- Run a simple experiment. By default, these files are set to run SASRec on ML-1M dataset.

``python3 main.py``
